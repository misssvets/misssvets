### Hi there, üëã.

### üî¨ What's in My Lab (and My Terminal)
My work is a fun mix of hands-on science and computational problem-solving. One day you'll find me at the bench doing gene cloning, and the next, I'll be lost in a simulation of protein.

* **Wet Lab Skills:** Gene Cloning & Expression, Protein Purification.
* **Dry Lab Skills:** * I use Molecular dynamics simulation to observe how my proteins move.
    * I vibe code my problems for computational work and am currently building up on my python skills.

### üõ†Ô∏è My Digital Toolkit
This is my stack of tools for building things, running simulations, and making sense of data.

* **Languages:** Python, Bash
* **Bio-Stack:** GROMACS, RDKit, PyMOL, Chimera, Autodock, Vina
* **Development:** Git, Conda, Anaconda, Linux

---
* **Research Associate:** working in the Protein Science Lab at Sharda University, under Prof. Amit Kumar Singh.
